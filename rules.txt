KEY POINTS:
	•	skirmish game designed to incorporate creative terrain without needing to use a tape measure
	•	the game is played on a board containing blocks, with models generally moving freely outside of blocks or within a block
	•	players take turns activating models to accomplish objectives or engage in combat… look, it’s basically malifaux

MOVE: movement occurs along a path that starts at the model’s initial position and ends at its final position
	•	models can spend an additional 1ap when declaring a move to move quick (avoid fire etc.)
	•	if a model moves into an enemy model’s engagement range, that model’s controller may end the move by taking a melee attack action at +1ap against the model
	•	if a model starts or ends a move in an enemy model’s sight, that enemy model may take a ranged attack at +1ap against the model; if the attack hits, instead of taking damage the model goes prone
	◦	If the enemy model has overwatch, the cost of the attack is not increased and it deals damage

PUSH: a move that occurs in a straight line and which cannot cross barriers

ACTIONS: models have actions that cost ap and which do various things

PATH: the space a model moves across while moving.  Paths cannot extend past the boundary of a block.  Paths can contain obstacles but not impassables.
	Obstacles in a path fall into the following categories:
	•	barrier: must spend 1ap to climb onto/over; any surface sufficiently vertical that a model cannot be placed on it is a barrier
	•	gap: any gap larger than the base of the model requires 1ap to jump over
	•	effect: terrain may apply an effect when moved through
	Impassables are objects with the impassable trait.  Large obstacles gain the impassable trait:
	•	impassable barrier: any barrier taller than 3”
	•	impassable gap: any open space larger than 3”
	•	models have the impassable trait unless otherwise specified

SIGHTLINE: any line that can be drawn from the center of a model through that model’s vision arc.  Sightlines cannot go through objects.  For the purpose of sightlines, models are cylinders with the model’s base and height

VISION ARC: each model has a section of their base that indicates the direction they are facing and what they can see.  A model is facing an object if a line drawn from the center of each goes through the model’s vision arc

ENGAGEMENT RANGE: usually the melee range of a model, measured from the edge of its base.
	•	When a model enters the engagement range of one or more enemy models, it must face one of those models
	•	While a model is in the engagement range of an enemy model, it cannot take actions that require focus
	•	Moving while engaged costs an extra 1ap but does not count as moving into an enemy’s engagement range

FOCUS: actions marked with (focus) require focus, and cannot be taken while engaged or under an effect that prevents focus

PRONE: a model that is prone receives some kind of disadvantage to its actions and must spend ap to end the prone condition

attacks work like malifaux: the model and the target (if any) flip cards and add the relevant stat; if the attacker matches or beats the target’s number, the attack succeeds.  Some actions allow models to spend ap to flip additional cards (or cause the enemy to flip additional cards and choose the lowest).  Players have a hand of cards that they can use to replace a flipped card

THE FUN STUFF:
	•	vault over a model: can spend 1ap during a move to vault over a model; on success, may land on the highest surface within 1" of the vaulted model; on failure drop the vaulting model onto the vaulted model and it ends up prone
	•	explosion: push models away from explosion
	•	fall: models take a point of fall damage any time they are pushed from a height of 2" or more; any models fallen onto take a point of damage


BASIC ACTIONS: all models can take basic actions
	•	2ap move: move the model to a new position along a path
	•	2ap charge (focus): push the model into engagement range with another model along a path with no barriers, then take a melee attack action against that model.  Reduce the cost of the melee attack by 2ap
	•	1ap interact (focus): do a thing within 1”
	•	1ap shove: 1” 1dmg +str -hgt
	◦	this melee attack instead pushes the target 1” for each damage
	•	0ap pass: reduce the model’s ap to 1 if greater than 1 and end its activation
	•	1ap overwatch (focus): the model gains overwatch; end the model’s activation
   - something like overmatch tokens to mark which areas they're watching and can have overwatch triggered in
